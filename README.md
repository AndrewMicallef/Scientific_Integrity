# Scientific Integrity

This work was inspired by a talk given by David Vaux about dodgy science.
The intent of this work is to randomly sample scientific articles funded by
the Australian taxpayer. Work by other people has suggested that the
reproducibility of scientific publications is below 10% and others have
estimated the rate of fraud to be around 5% (citations to come).

Australia currently has no official body dedicated to overseeing research
integrity. So the question that popped into my mind was: Do we need one?
In my mind the best way to answer that question would be to ask a different
question: what are the rates of fraud in Australian research?

Answering that question requires either a census of all published work by
Australian scientists (more work than I could concieve of by myself) OR
generating an estimate through the use of random sampling. The notebooks here
are the first steps in taking a random sampling approach to answer the above
questions.
